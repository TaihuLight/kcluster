# kcluster - Multiple Genomics Cancer Subtype Discovery using Multiple Kernel Learning

kcluster is an open-source toolkit for applying kernel methods to cancer subtype discovery, specifically using Multiple Kernel Learning, k-means clustering, and stochastic optimization to generate subtype clusters for a given cancer dataset. 

kcluster provides a Python API that can be run on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets. 

To read more about kcluster, please refer to "Kernel Learning Framework For Cancer Subtype Analysis with Mutli-omics Data Integration" (Bradbury, Lau, Roy 2015).
